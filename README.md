# PackDB

Simple key-value store written in C.

> [!WARNING]
> I wrote this project with my own ideas on key-value stores. I did'nt read any article or book. This is my starting point to learn about databases.

## Status

Currently packDB has a working back-end and tested data-structures but the front-end part (REPL / Socket / HTTP) is not implemented yet.

## Build

Build packDB from source:
```bash
make
```

run packDB executable:
```bash
./build/packdb
```
